## Project Overview

This repository contains the analytical work for the BA870 Individual Project, focusing on the "Financial & Accounting Analytics of Stock Market Crashes". The project aims to uncover the financial and accounting factors that influence the performance of U.S. stocks during significant market downturns.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on financial and stock return data during five key stock market crashes:

1987 Stock Market Crash (Sept 1987 – Dec 1987)

Dot Com Bubble and Crash (Jan 2000 – Oct 2002)

Great Recession & Financial Crisis (Jan 2008 – Feb 2009)

The Covid Shock (Feb 2020 – March 2020)

“The End of Easy Money” (Jan 2022 – Sep 2022)

Data were retrieved from provided CSV files with ticker symbols and corresponding financial report data from Compustat and monthly stock return data from CRSP, along with the Fama-French factor returns data.


## Analysis Workflow
**Data Collection:**  Compiled financial and stock return data corresponding to provided ticker symbols for the crash periods.

**Data Cleaning:** Processed and prepared the datasets for analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
Risk Exposure Determination: Analyzed the stocks' sensitivities to market-wide risk factors.

**Financial Ratio Calculation:** Computed key financial ratios to assess the financial health and performance of companies.
