Among the variables, several sectors (gsector) show statistically significant relationships with the return.The coefficients of the gsector variables suggest that being in certain sectors has a positive impact on the return. Specifically, gsector_15.0, gsector_20.0, gsector_30.0, gsector_35.0, gsector_55.0, and gsector_60.0 have statistically significant coefficients. This means that being in these sectors is associated with an increase in the return. The magnitudes of these effects can be seen from the coefficients themselves (e.g., gsector_15.0 has a coefficient of 0.0449)."],"metadata":{"id":"N-oC2M2o70oz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### cleaning and merging"],"metadata":{"id":"HSGFGyJ1KiqH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["industry_1983_87 = pd.read_csv(data_folder_2 + 'GSECTOR-1986.csv')\n","industry_1983_87.head(5)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":0},"id":"KxJ6EGsq76fZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683359333699,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Harshil Thakkar","userId":"02573712288266166826"}},"outputId":"be978af8-15fe-4f9c-d0e1-3738ed63c88f"},"execution_count":264,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   gvkey  fyear     tic  gsector\n","0   1003   1986    ANTQ     25.0\n","1   1004   1986     AIR     20.0\n","2   1009   1986  ABSI.1     15.0\n","3   1010   1986   4165A     20.0\n","4   1011   1986    ACSE     25.0"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-259a2d03-b31e-45aa-b727-3094fd5c3b46\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>gvkey</th>\n","      <th>fyear</th>\n","      <th>tic</th>\n","      <th>gsector</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1003</td>\n","      <td>1986</td>\n","      <td>ANTQ</td>\n","      <td>25.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1004</td>\n","      <td>1986</td>\n","      <td>AIR</td>\n","      <td>20.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>1009</td>\n","      <td>1986</td>\n","      <td>ABSI.1</td>\n","      <td>15.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>1010</td>\n","      <td>1986</td>\n","      <td>4165A</td>\n","      <td>20.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>1011</td>\n","      <td>1986</td>\n","      <td>ACSE</td>\n","      <td>25.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-259a2d03-b31e-45aa-b727-3094fd5c3b46')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-259a2d03-b31e-45aa-b727-3094fd5c3b46 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
